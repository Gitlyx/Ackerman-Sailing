TODO Format:
Fix what, what behaviour, behaviour expected.

/editRoute
    Fix validation. Numbers will not invoke any error message, and is accepted as an input variable in client but not on backend. Implement error handling and stop redirection. 
        - db should accept number input for this field.
    
/newRoute
    Fix validation. Entering numbers is not handled and will pass though fetch call and redirection. Handle this before fetch call. to stop propagation.

/trip (FIXED)
    Fix render. Delete does not re render but still empties entry internally. Neds re-render component on delete call to reflect changes.

/editTrip
    Fix validation on frontend. Currently accepts empty field. validation needed for stop redirect.
    Fix validation on frontend. Empty date is accepted but no change on state. Needs validation to stop submit of empty string.
